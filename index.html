	      This course is about developing software, creating game aplication, running tests, producing documents and creating programs that run on different platforms
	      To pass this course is an absolute challenge, one will have to demonstrate proficience to an acceptable level in all aspects of the course.
	      But I'm quietly confident that I can make it in this course.  
              This addition was made while in the master branch.
